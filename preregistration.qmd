## Power Analysis

To determine the sample sizes required for our replication, I conducted two a priori power analyses using the `pwr` package in R (v.1.3-0). My goal was to estimate the number of L2 participants needed to (1) detect a difference in reaction times between L1 and L2 groups and (2) detect an interaction between group and condition.

### Main Effect of Group (L1 vs. L2)

Werkmann Horvat et al. (2021) report a post-hoc comparison between L1 and advanced L2 speakers with a z-value of 4.77 (*p* < .0001). Assuming a sample size of approximately 103 participants for that analysis, I converted the z-value to an estimated Cohen’s *d* = 0.94, 95% CI [0.56, 1.33], using the `effectsize::z_to_d()` function.

Using this effect size, I ran a power analysis for a two-sample *t*-test with unequal group sizes. Assuming I will retain the original 48 L1 participants and recruit new L2 participants, this analysis indicates that approximately **23 L2 participants** are required to detect a significant group difference with 80% power.

```{r}
library(pwr)
pwr.t2n.test(n1 = 48, d = 0.94, power = 0.80, sig.level = 0.05)
```

### Group × Condition Interaction

Werkmann Horvat et al. (2021) also report a significant Group × Condition interaction: *F*(4, 177.04) = 2.53, *p* = .04. From this, I estimated an effect size of *f²* = 0.057 by converting η²:

$$
\eta^2 = \frac{F \cdot df_1}{F \cdot df_1 + df_2} = \frac{2.53 \cdot 4}{2.53 \cdot 4 + 177.04} \approx 0.054 \\
f^2 = \frac{0.054}{1 - 0.054} \approx 0.057
$$

I used this in a multiple regression power analysis:

```{r}
pwr.f2.test(u = 4, f2 = 0.057, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.80)
```

This yielded a required error degrees of freedom *v* ≈ 209.19, corresponding to a **total sample size of approximately 213 participants** to detect the interaction with 80% power.

### Summary

| Effect                          | Test Type             | Effect Size   | Estimated N           |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| L1 vs. L2 group difference      | Two-sample *t*-test   | *d* = 0.94     | 23 L2 (w/ 48 L1s)      |
| Group × Condition interaction   | Multiple regression    | *f²* = 0.057   | 213 total (165 L2 and 48 L1) participants |

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
